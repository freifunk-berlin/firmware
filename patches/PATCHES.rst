PATCHES
#######

Local patches are now handeled is the same way as Freifunk Gluon is doing it. So you can refer to the documentation there
(https://gluon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/basics.html#working-with-repositories). A small inofficial list is also around
( https://gist.github.com/kokel/7708f776c926b4bed89c).

In short:
* patches will be taken from patches/openwrt of patches/packages/<feed>
* work on the "patched" branch of the OpenWrt-repo / feeds-repo
