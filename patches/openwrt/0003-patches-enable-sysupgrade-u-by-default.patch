Subject: [PATCH] enable "sysupgrade -u" by default

This enables the "-u" option of sysupgrade by default, as discussed in #641.
To unset this default we add "-U" to revert to OpenWrt default.

Having this option by default will avoid the putting files into the backup,
which are unmodified from /rom. This way we can fix issue #637 (a race
condition we have seen in our uplink-configuration).
