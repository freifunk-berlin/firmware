# Freifunk Firmware Berlin

## Release Note 0.1.0 - codename kathleen

*[Kathleen Booth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Booth) was the author of the first assembly language*.

The purpose for this release is to have a stable firmware for beginners for the Freifunk mesh in Berlin.
The firmware itself is based on vanilla OpenWRT Barrier Breaker with some modifications (to fix
broken stuff in OpenWRT itself or for example luci) and additional default packages/configuration settings.
New features like a new network concept will be part of future releases.

**Features**
* based on OpenWRT Barrier Breaker release
* update OLSRD to v0.6.7.1
* new OLSR setup and configuration:
  * SmartGateway for gateway selection (e.g. honors uplink speed)
  * dynamic gateway plugin for uplink connectivity tests (gwcheck script removed)
  * freifunk-policyrouting fixed/patched for VPN03 setup
* new configuration [wizard](https://github.com/freifunk-berlin/packages-berlin/tree/master/utils/luci-app-ffwizard-berlin)
  * starts after first boot and guides new users through the configuration of the router
* monitoring of nodes through collectd
* frei.funk as local DNS entry for your router
  * you do not have to remember your IP to get access
* change default lan ip address to 192.168.42.1/24
  * avoids network collisions
* one dhcp network for APs and lan (bridged)
* remove of autoipv6 and use of ULA ipv6 prefixes
* new primary router target: TP-Link WDR 3500/3600/4300
* default dns servers:
  * 85.214.20.141 (FoeBud / Digital Courage)
  * 213.73.91.35 (CCC Berlin)
  * 194.150.168.168 (dns.as250.net)

For questions write a mail to <berlin@berlin.freifunk.net> or come to our weekly meetings.
If you find bugs please report them at: https://github.com/freifunk-berlin/firmware/issues

A tutorial on router configuration is available at
http://berlin.freifunk.net/participate/howto/. Currently only in German. We are
working on a translation.

## Info

For the Berlin Freifunk firmware we use vanilla OpenWRT with additional patches
and packages. The Makefile automates firmware
creation and apply patches / integrates custom freifunk packages. All custom
patches are located in *patches/* and all additional packages can be found at
http://github.com/freifunk-berlin/packages_berlin.

## Releases

Every release has a [semantic version number](http://semver.org) and a codename.
We name our releases after important female computer scientists, hackers, etc.
For inspiration please take a look at the related
[ticket](https://github.com/freifunk-berlin/firmware/issues/24).

Stable releases are hosted on the buildbot master instance:

[http://buildbot.berlin.freifunk.net/buildbot/stable/](http://buildbot.berlin.freifunk.net/buildbot/stable/)

## Development

To get the source and build the firmware locally use:


```
git clone https://github.com/freifunk-berlin/firmware.git
cd firmware
make
```

Then the ImageBuilder files end up in the directory `bin`. You can find the
actuall firmware generated by the ImageBuilder in `firmwares`.

### Required packages

Please take a look at the [openWrt documenation](http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/howto/buildroot.exigence#examples.of.package.installations)
for a complete and uptodate list of packages for your operating system. Make
sure the list contains `quilt`. We use it for patch management.

#### Ubuntu/Debian

```
apt-get install git subversion build-essential libncurses5-dev zlib1g-dev gawk \
  unzip libxml-perl flex wget gawk libncurses5-dev gettext quilt python
```

### Continuous integration

The firmware is [built
automatically](http://buildbot.berlin.freifunk.net/one_line_per_build) by our [buildbot farm](http://buildbot.berlin.freifunk.net/buildslaves). If you have a bit of CPU+RAM+storage capacity on one of your servers, you can provide a buildbot slave (see [berlin-buildbot](https://github.com/freifunk/berlin-buildbot)).

### Patches with quilt

**Important:** all patches should be pushed upstream!

If a patch is not yet included upstream, it can be placed in the `patches` directory with the `quilt` tool. Please configure `quilt` as described in the [openwrt wiki](http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/patches) (which also provides a documentation of `quilt`).

#### Add, modify or delete a patch

In order to add, modify or delete a patch run:

```bash
make clean pre-patch
```
Then switch to the openwrt directory:

```bash
cd openwrt
```
Now you can use the `quilt` commands as described in the [openwrt wiki](http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/patches).

##### Example: add a patch

```bash
quilt push -a                 # apply all patches
quilt new 008-awesome.patch   # tell quilt to create a new patch
quilt edit somedir/somefile1  # edit files
quilt edit somedir/somefile2
quilt refresh                 # creates/updates the patch file
```

### Submitting patches

#### openwrt

Create a commit in the openwrt directory that contains your change. Use `git
format-patch` to create a patch:

```
git format-patch origin
```

Send a patch to the openwrt mailing list with `git send-email`:

```
git send-email \
  --to=openwrt-devel@lists.openwrt.org \
  --smtp-server=mail.foo.bar \
  --smtp-user=foo \
  --smtp-encryption=tls \
  0001-a-fancy-change.patch
```

Additional information: https://dev.openwrt.org/wiki/SubmittingPatches

### Creating a release

For a new release create a new branch. The branch name must be a semantic version
number. Make sure you change the codename and semantic version number in the
README and config files (./configs/*)

The buildbot will build the release and place the files in the stable direcotry
once you pushed the new branch to github.
